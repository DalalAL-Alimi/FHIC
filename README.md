## Abstract
Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are typically utilized in a wide variety of practical applications. HSI is replete with spatial and spectral information, which provides precise data for material detection. HSIs are characterized by a high degree of variations and undesirable pixel distributions, providing major processing challenges. This article introduces the fast hyperspectral image classification (FHIC) model, a rapid model for classifying HSIs and resolving their associated challenges. It uses the enhancing transformation reduction (ETR) method to address the HSI difficulties and enhance classesâ€™ differentiation. It also uses exponential linear units (ELUs) to smooth and speed the classification processing. The structure of the FHIC model is designed to be very flexible and suitable for a range of HSIs. The model reduced execution time and RAM consumption, and provided superior performance compared to seven of the most advanced analysis models for three well-known HSIs. In some cases, it was 60% faster than other models. In addition, this work presents a new and highly effective method for measuring the performance of the compared models in terms of their accuracy and processing speed to provide an easy evaluation method.
